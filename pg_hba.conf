# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# This file controls client authentication, and is loaded on server startup.
# See the documentation for details on how to configure authentication.
#
# The default method for authenticating users is "trust" (no password required).
# This file is read on each connection attempt, so changes take effect immediately.
#
# Each record consists of:
#   - a connection type (host, hostssl, hostnossl, local)
#   - a database name (or "all" for all databases)
#   - a user name (or "all" for all users)
#   - a client IP address/netmask (or "all" for any)
#   - an authentication method (e.g., trust, md5, password, peer, etc.)

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# Local connections
# ---------------
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     peer

# IPv4 local connections:
# ---------------
# "host" is for TCP/IP connections
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

# IPv6 local connections:
# ---------------
# "host" is for TCP/IP connections
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust

# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust

# Allow connections to all databases from any host with valid credentials
# (Use appropriate authentication method for your use case, e.g., md5)
#host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
